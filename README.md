# Invoice App

A modern, feature-rich invoice management application for seamless tracking, creation, and editing of invoices.

## ‚ú® Features

- Developed a comprehensive invoice management application with a **dynamic popup form** to add and edit invoice details.  
- Editable status option that allows users to update invoice statuses (e.g., Paid, Pending, Draft) directly on the invoice details page for enhanced control and flexibility.  
- Created an **Items Component** inside the popup to add items with a name, price, and quantity, automatically calculating totals and updating the invoice in real-time.  
- Applied a **component-based architecture** with a focus on state management and reusability, ensuring scalable, maintainable, and performant code.  
- Utilized **React Router** to manage dynamic routing between pages, ensuring seamless navigation across different views like the dashboard, invoice details, and forms.
